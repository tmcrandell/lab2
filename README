LAB 2: Andrew Maus and Michael Crandell
06FEB18

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This lab creates the scenery (sky and ground) for a launcher, and draws the actual launcher. If the up/down arrows are pressed, the launcher will change its angle accordingly. If the left/right keys are  pressed, the magnitude will increase or decrease.

Eventually we will launch projectiles from the launcher, and it will account for gravity.
